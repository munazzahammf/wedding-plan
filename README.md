## Github Workflow to be Followed
If you have made any changes to your code base.

1. Create a new branch before commiting.
    `git branch <branch-name>`
2. Then select that branch.
    `git checkout <branch-name>`
3. Add the changes to that branch.
    `git add .`
4. Commit the changes to the branch.
    `git commit -m "<commit messsage>"`
5. After committing select the main branch.
    `git checkout main`
6. Then pull the changes from the remote repository
    `git pull`
7. Then merge the changes you committed to your new branch.
    `git merge <branch-name>`
8. Again push the changes to the remote repository
    `git push`
